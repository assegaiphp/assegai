## <a name="question-or-problem"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

**Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.** If you do have general support quetions, then [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/assegaiphp) where the questions should be tagged with tag `assegaiphp`.

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- Questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else
- Stack Overflow's voting system assures taht the best answers are prominently visible.

To save yours and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.

If you would like to thcat about the question in real-time, you can reach out via [our discord channel]()

## <a name="issues-and-bugs"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source ode, you can help us by
- [Submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue)
- [Submitting a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request) with a fix.

## <a name="feature-requests"></a> Missing a Feature?

You can _request_ a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to _implement_a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. For your issue name, please prefix your proposal with `[discussion]`, for example "[discussion]: your feature idea".

### <a name="submitting-an-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as oon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reprodcution scenario using a repository or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with addtional questions like:

- version of Assegai used
- 3rd-party libraries and their versions
- and most importantly - a use-case that fails

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you we are going to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

You can file new issues by filling out our [new issue form](https://github.com/atatusoft/assegai/)
